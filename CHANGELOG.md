- Changelog

### Changed

- `NUM_LEDS` renamed to `MAX_LEDS` (200) as compile-time buffer max; active count is now runtime-configurable
- Static HTML test page replaced with interactive control UI
- Web server tx_buffer increased to 4096 to fit HTML page
- Upgraded esp-hal to 1.0.0 (from 1.0.0-beta.0)
- Replaced esp-wifi with esp-radio 0.17.0
- Replaced esp-hal-embassy with esp-rtos 0.2.0
- Bumped embassy-executor to 0.9.1, embassy-time to 0.5.0, embassy-net to 0.8.0
- Bumped esp-alloc to 0.9.0, embedded-io to 0.7.1, embedded-io-async to 0.7.0
- Manual RTOS scheduler init with esp_rtos::start() instead of #[esp_rtos::main] macro

### Removed

- ws2812-esp32-rmt-driver (incompatible with bare-metal no_std)
